I made this repo to practice a bunch of things.

- replicate the item cards from elden ring
- organize the code in such a way that state management is easy
- learn about getStaticProps / getServerSideProps / data fetching with nextjs

## New goals

I want to attach a database to my application using Supabase.
Todo:

1. Create users
2. Allow users to login / logout
3. Allow users to 'build' their own Elden Ring character builds
