I made this repo to practice a bunch of things.

- replicate the item cards from elden ring
- organize the code in such a way that state management is easy
- learn about getStaticProps / getServerSideProps / data fetching with nextjs

## Todo:

1. Study & move from supabase to mongodb
2. Study & possibly add TRPC
3. Implement 'adding items' to a build list functionality for users.

I was using supabase because I thought it would be easy but I think that noSQL might be a better fit for me since I am more used to NoSQL. In hindsight I should've thought about it bettter before setting up Supabase. Luckily I hadn't really used supabase that much anyway.
